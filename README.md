Just another library to make life easier.

## Vectors ##
Vectors used in math and physics.

## Bounded Numbers ##
Bounded numbers are number containers that keep numbers bounded in a set range.

### Default ###
The default bounded number limits the number between an upper and lower bound.
A bounded number 5 with a bounds of 0 and 10 would result in 10 when 15 was added to it.

### Looping ###
Looping numbers will wrap around when the limits have been exceeded.
For example the number 7 with bounds of 0 and 10 would result in 2 when 5 was added to it.
